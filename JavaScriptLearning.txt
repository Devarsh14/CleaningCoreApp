Javascript Functions ::

1. define a Javascript functions using 
function(){
    -- Provide function details 
    -- mainly Dom manipulation in case of Playing around with css and animations
    -- Provide  a function details what need to be do onclick, hover or document load kind of functionality 
    
}
-- example 
function showalert(){
     alert('You Clicked Button');
}    
document.getElementById("Names1").onclick = showalert; -- functions eachtime you click and work as desired 
document.getElementById("Names1").onclick = showalert(); -- () is a execution parameter for the function is Javascript
so, function will not work each time if you have assigned with showalert() --- will executes at Page load in Dom
and function will not execute on click if it assign as showalert() execute ones 

if Function assign with document.getElementById("Names1").onclick = showalert; 
executes eachtime when its called 
if assign with document.getElementById("Names1").onclick = showalert();
execute on pageload and will not execute again and you will scratch your head....hahhah


This function provides alert when user clicks on webpage with specific ID,
this function only triggers when user click on a element so its onclick function 
On click function directly can be provided to element in browser to call as well rathar than scriptinog in script

<p id="para">Some text here</p>
  <button onclick="changeColor('blue');">blue</button>
  <button onclick="changeColor('red');">red</button>

function changeColor(newColor) {
  var elem = document.getElementById('para');
  elem.style.color = newColor;
}

changeColor('orange');  --- This is a example why function was not working on click in my script which I have written in first block. 


Javascript events can be triggered with :
1. click
2.onclick
3.webpage load
4.image loaded
5.mouse over or hover
6.when input field has changed 
7. Form is submitted
8. when user do the keystrokes 



:::: Example for getting Elment byID OR CLASS OR ANYTHING  and Make multiple evnts on it 
1. in this code getElementById is performed and stored elment into the variable 
2. Then on that stored element various event addEventListener performed 

its almost same as getElementById('').onclick=function;
but here multiple functions added to same element usinng addEventListener function and perfomrs multiple 
function on element without redefining element and works fine. 
<script>
var x = document.getElementById("myBtn");
x.addEventListener("mouseover", myFunction);
x.addEventListener("click", mySecondFunction);
x.addEventListener("mouseout", myThirdFunction);

function myFunction() {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += "Moused over!<br>";
}

function mySecondFunction() {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += "Clicked!<br>";
}

function myThirdFunction() {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += "Moused out!<br>";
}
</script>
